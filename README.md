# Qiskit Projects

Welcome to my collection of Python projects built with the Qiskit library. This repository showcases my work in quantum computing, including football match analysis, quantum circuits, and password cracking.

## Projects

### 1. FBvGS.py - Football Match Analysis
- **Description**: Analyzes a Fenerbah√ße vs. Galatasaray football match (1-2, Galatasaray win) using Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT).
- **Details**: 
  - Converts Galatasaray's attacks into signals based on expected goals (xG).
  - Applies QFT to analyze the xG signals.
- **Technologies**: Python, Qiskit

### 2. Qiskit_Proje.py - Simple Quantum Circuit
- **Description**: Implements a basic quantum circuit with three qubits.
- **Details**:
  - Uses Hadamard (H), Pauli-X (X), and Toffoli (CCX) gates.
  - Compares the circuit's state before and after applying the gates.
- **Technologies**: Python, Qiskit

### 3. Qiskit_Proje2.py & Qiskit_Proje2_2.py - Password Cracking
- **Description**: Develops a quantum circuit for password cracking.
- **Details**:
  - `Qiskit_Proje2.py`: Initial attempt (contains errors).
  - `Qiskit_Proje2_2.py`: Corrected version of the circuit.
- **Technologies**: Python, Qiskit
